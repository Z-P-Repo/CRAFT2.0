# Activity API 500 Error - Resolution Summary

## Problem
The activity page was showing a 500 status error because:
1. The backend did not have the `/api/v1/activities` endpoint implemented
2. The ActivityService was trying to create activities via non-existent API routes
3. The frontend was making API calls to endpoints that didn't exist

## Solution Implemented

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend Changes

1. **Created Activity Model** (`/src/models/Activity.ts`)
   - Full MongoDB schema with proper indexing
   - Support for all activity types and categories
   - Validation and virtual fields
   - Performance optimizations

2. **Created Activity Controller** (`/src/controllers/ActivityController.ts`)
   - `GET /activities` - List activities with filtering/pagination
   - `GET /activities/:id` - Get specific activity
   - `POST /activities` - Create new activity
   - `GET /activities/stats` - Get activity statistics
   - `POST /activities/export` - Export activities

3. **Created Activity Routes** (`/src/routes/activityRoutes.ts`)
   - Proper route definitions with authentication
   - REST API endpoints following existing patterns

4. **Updated Main Routes** (`/src/routes/index.ts`)
   - Added activity routes to main router
   - Updated API info endpoint

5. **Created Activity Seed Data** (`/src/seeds/activitySeed.ts`)
   - Sample activities for testing
   - Realistic data across all categories and types

### üé® Frontend Changes

1. **Improved Activity Service** (`/src/lib/activityService.ts`)
   - API availability checking
   - Graceful fallback when API is unavailable
   - Better error handling and logging

2. **Enhanced Activity Page** (`/src/app/activity/page.tsx`)
   - API status indicator (Live Data / Demo Mode)
   - Graceful fallback to mock data
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Retry functionality

3. **Updated API Client** (`/src/lib/api.ts`)
   - Added activity management methods
   - Proper TypeScript support

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd craft-backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start Frontend Server
```bash
cd craft-frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Seed Sample Data (Optional)
If you want to test with real data:
```bash
cd craft-backend
npm run seed  # If seed script includes activities
# OR manually run the activity seeder
```

### 4. Test Activity Page
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/activity`
2. You should see:
   - **If API is working**: "Live Data" status and real activities from backend
   - **If API is down**: "Demo Mode" status with mock data and retry button

### 5. Verify API Endpoints
Test the backend API directly:
```bash
# Get activities (requires auth token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/api/v1/activities

# Get health check
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health
```

## Features Available

### ‚úÖ **Working Features**
- Activity listing with pagination
- Advanced filtering (category, severity, type)
- Search functionality
- Activity detail modal
- Statistics dashboard
- API status monitoring
- Export functionality (backend ready)
- Responsive design

### üîÑ **Fallback Behavior**
- Automatic detection of API availability
- Seamless fallback to demo data
- User notification of current mode
- Retry functionality
- No crashes or breaking errors

### üìä **Activity Categories**
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, security events
- **Administration**: User/policy/resource management
- **Compliance**: Audit trails, compliance checks
- **Operation**: Data operations, system operations
- **Configuration**: System settings, configuration changes
- **Integration**: API calls, external system interactions
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, performance metrics
- **User Activity**: Individual user actions

## Database Schema
The Activity model supports:
- 13 activity types (authentication, policy_management, etc.)
- 8 categories (security, administration, etc.)
- 4 severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Rich metadata (IP address, user agent, changes, etc.)
- Full-text search indexing
- Performance-optimized queries

## Performance Optimizations
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for large datasets
- Efficient aggregation queries for statistics
- Client-side caching and memoization
- Virtualized table rendering (frontend ready)

## Security Considerations
- Authentication required for all activity endpoints
- Sensitive data sanitization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting (can be added)
- Audit trail integrity

The 500 error should now be resolved. The system will work in both connected (live data) and disconnected (demo mode) scenarios, providing a robust user experience regardless of API availability.
