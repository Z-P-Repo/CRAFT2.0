## 📖 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Consistent naming conventions
- Component organization

### Best Practices
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all API responses including policy count data
- Implement error boundaries
- Follow React best practices
- Write meaningful tests including policy dependency scenarios
- Use semantic HTML
- Implement consistent auto-refresh patterns across entity pages
- Use Material-UI Chip components for policy count display
- Add tooltips for enhanced user experience

### Policy Dependency UI Patterns
- **Policy Count Display**: Use `<Chip>` components with `color="primary"` for policy counts with accurate ID-based backend mapping
- **Tooltips**: Show up to 5 policy names in tooltips, with "and X more" for additional policies  
- **Auto-refresh**: Implement window focus and 30-second periodic refresh for data consistency
- **Manual Refresh**: Provide refresh buttons with loading states and descriptive tooltips
- **Column Headers**: Use single-line headers with appropriate widths (180px for "Created By")
- **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly messages for deletion protection errors
- **Data Consistency**: Policy creation and display now use consistent entity ID references ensuring accurate policy counts and deletion protection
- **Delete Modals**: Standardized DeleteConfirmationDialog component with close icons, clean design, system protection warnings, loading states, and entity-specific messaging

## 📋 Activity System

The CRAFT system includes a comprehensive activity monitoring and audit trail system that tracks all significant events across the application.

### Activity Features
- **Real-time Activity Feed** - Live updates of system activities with automatic refresh
- **Advanced Filtering** - Filter by category, severity, type, actor, and date range
- **Activity Categories** - 8 main categories: Security, Administration, Compliance, Operation, Configuration, Integration, Monitoring, User Activity
- **Severity Levels** - 4 levels: Low, Medium, High, Critical with color-coded indicators
- **Detailed Activity Views** - Modal dialogs with complete activity information including metadata
- **API Status Detection** - Automatic fallback to demo mode when backend is unavailable
- **Export Capabilities** - CSV and JSON export for compliance and reporting
- **Smart Activity Tracking** - Automatic activity creation throughout the application

### Activity Types Tracked
- **Authentication Events** - Login, logout, password changes
- **Authorization Events** - Access granted/denied, permission checks
- **Policy Management** - Policy creation, updates, deletions
- **User Management** - User account changes, role modifications
- **Resource Management** - Resource creation, updates, deletions
- **System Configuration** - Settings changes, configuration updates
- **Security Events** - Suspicious activities, security violations
- **Audit Activities** - Compliance checks, system audits

### Activity Service Integration
The activity system provides easy integration throughout the application:

```typescript
import { trackAuth, trackPolicy, trackUser } from '@/lib/activityService';

// Track authentication events
await trackAuth('login', true);

// Track policy changes
await trackPolicy('created', 'policy-123', 'New Security Policy');

// Track user management
await trackUser('updated', 'user-456', 'John Doe');
```
